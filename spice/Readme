ObtenIDs.py will download all the SPK Kernels from the NEOs SPKIDs in NEO_results.csv (from small bodies DB) in ./Kernels/neos 
(YOU SHOULD CREATE THE FOLDER!, we deleted it and the current content as it did not make sense to upload the current 14K Binary SPKs).

Rest api will provide with a REST API that will interact with BOKEH and SPICE.
